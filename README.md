## Context
Habit Analytics provides an API and Mobile Application that allows anyone to transform a Dumb device into a Smart Device and create use cases between different devices or event providers.


## Challenge
Control any Device with one single App!

Imagine an usecase that you would like to reach, creating interactions between IoT devices or external APIs.

Some examples:
- Transform your own Dumb device into a Smart Device
- Integrate with a weather API and change our Dome lights (LIFX) accordinatly
- Create a Smart Device with our Hardware (Arduino/RasperryPi/Boards/Lights)
    
## How to Apply
* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [application-example-at-habit-io.md](https://github.com/habitio/PixelCamp/blob/master/application-example-at-habit-io.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your email (ex: support-at-habit-io.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Find a Habit member on the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive an Arduino board to create an IoT device or to receive credentials for one of available IoT Devices.


## Requirements for integrations
* Install [Muzzley App](https://cdn.muzzley.com/apk/muzzley-v3.apk) (apk) on your phone or emulator
* Follow our integration [documentation](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io) 
    * We will help you setup the [Device Specification](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device-specifications), no need to do the described configuration.
    
## Hardware available
We will have several arduinos, raspberry's and boards, that you can use to create your project.
You may also use one our Lifx Lights on Habit's Dome.
