# Habit Challenges
## Goal
Control any Device with one single App!
    
Habit Analytics provides an API and Mobile Application that allows anyone to transform a Dumb device into a Smart Device and create automation rules between different devices.
    
Create your project with our API and App, by using one of our Devices or your own!
    
Ask Habit for:
An Arduino Board to transform a Dumb LED into a Smart LED!

OR

Access to one of our Smart Devices

OR 

Tell us what kind for device you want to create!
    
## How to Apply
* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [application-example-at-habit-io.md](https://github.com/habitio/PixelCamp/blob/master/application-example-at-habit-io.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your email (ex: support-at-habit-io.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Find a Habit member on the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive an Arduino board to create an IoT device or to receive credentials for one of available IoT Devices.


## Requirements for integration
* Install [Muzzley App](https://cdn.muzzley.com/apk/muzzley-v3.apk) (apk) on your phone or emulator
* Follow our integration [documentation](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io) 
    * We will help you setup the [Device Specification](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device-specifications), no need to do the described configuration.
    
## Hardware available
Use our Arduino Board to control the Led light and develop a software that will interact between the Arduino, the Muzzley App and Habit/Muzzley API

OR

Use one our Lifx Lights on Habit's Dome
