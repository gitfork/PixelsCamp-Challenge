# Habit Challenge
## Goal
    1. Create and control your own IoT device, by doing an integration of the Device with the Muzzley App.
    OR
    2. Create an integration of one of the available IoT devices on the Habit's Dome
    
## How to Apply
* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [application-example-at-habit-io.md](https://github.com/habitio/PixelCamp/blob/master/application-example-at-habit-io.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your email (ex: support-at-habit-io.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Find a Habit member on the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive an Arduino board to create an IoT device or to receive credentials for one of available IoT Devices.


## Requirements for Device2Cloud integration
* Install [Muzzley App](https://cdn.muzzley.com/apk/muzzley-v3.apk) (apk) on your phone or emulator
* Follow our documentation regarding [Device to Cloud](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/integrate-devices/device-to-cloud) integration
    * We will help you setup the [Device Specification](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device-specifications), no need to do the described configuration.
    
## Hardware available
* Use our Arduino Board to control the Led light
* Develop a software that will interact between the Arduino, the Muzzley App and Habit/Muzzley API
* Your Arduino board must be returned with the project submittion
OR
* Use one our Lifx Lights on Habit's Dome
