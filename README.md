# Habit Challenge

![Habit](https://github.com/habitio/PixelsCamp-Challenge/blob/master/illustration.png)

## Context
Habit Analytics provides an IoT platform, APIs and Mobile Applications to bring creativity into people and mostly ease peopleâ€™s lives. Meaning that DIY masters can use the platform to transform Dumb Devices into a Smart remote controlled Devices or automate their full houses.

You donâ€™t need to read this part, but... On a business perspective, Habit mostly works with enterprise companies that want to enrich their services by connecting them with IoT. Think of this as dispatching emergency services that react to an IoT smoke detector, or a caregiver that will call a family member when grandparents activity is out of the norm! Weâ€™re the tech behind these types of services, which also gives us a lot of space to play with cool stuff...


## Challenge
Prank into Ease someoneâ€™s life, home or your bat-cave ðŸ¦‡.

What do we give you:

1. An IoT platform, its APIâ€™s and ready made mobile APPs
2. Access to listen in real-time the IoT data that results from the interaction of your mobile APP and your IoT device
3. Electronics and microcontrollers, in case you want to bring hardware into the scene! At your disposal a table full of ESP8266, raspberry-pis, arduinos and electronic kits. Please donâ€™t ask us to install drivers on your old toshiba windows 95 computer or your new shinny macbook. We expect you to master it!
4. Workshops during Pixelâ€™s camp to give you a boost on how the platform works. Calendar: March 22nd, 10:00AM and 2:00PM at Pixelâ€™s camp. Ask whereâ€™s Habitâ€™s Dome!)

What can you do:

Well.. the sky is the limit..

Imagination is the key to this challenge, but we can give you some ideas:

1. Prank your coworker by turning off the light at a random number of seconds after he/she turns it on: Out platform, a microcontroller, and a couple of relays would do the trick!
2. Be nice to your grandmother and build her an irrigation system so she can spend her time preparing you cookies: A microcontroller and a water valve would be the key ingredients. 
3. Connect the weather service API to Habitâ€™s and create engenius automations with devices. 
4. Save the planet: Combine motion and light sensors and create awareness inside your company on how lights are efficiently being used.
5. Create the coolest pixelâ€™s camp badgeâ€¦ A remote controlled one? 
6. Integrate with a SMS/TEXT/CHAT API and allow others to control our Pixel campâ€™s Dome lights 
7. Be the perfect grandchild: Build a location tracker for your sporty driver grandma and surprise her everytime sheâ€™s at the groceries store to carry her bags!

[Important] Please understand that our ideas are funny ways to describe different use cases around our platform. We donâ€™t encourage anyone to build devices that can injury people, not respect laws or break any privacy right! Though, we encourage you to be the coolest kid on the house! ðŸ˜Ž

Show us your best idea and our team will be onsite to help you!

    
## How to Apply
* Mail us to pixelscamp@habit.io with your name, github user and your project ideia so that we can share with you your API credentials 
* Find a Habit member at the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive some hardware if necessary or for any question that you may have.



## Requirements for integrations
* Install [Muzzley App](https://cdn.muzzley.com/apk/muzzley-v3-qa.apk) (apk) on your phone or emulator or ask us for beta tester access to our iOS Application
* Our API uses the OAuth2.0 protocol for authentication, so you will need a set of credentials. Find us on the event or get in touch to [pixelscamp@habit.io](pixelscamp@habit.io) to get yours!
* Follow our integration [documentation](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io) 
    * We have already created a generic [specification of a Device](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device-specifications) for you to use with your project:
    
            * 1 compoment with the following properties:
            
                * 1 property status (true/false)    

                * 4 properties for strings (property1, property2, property3, property4)
              
                * 1 property image (url)
                
                * 1 property orientation (up/down/left/right)
                
    * And we have created a generic interface that will allow you to control your device. It will appear on your Muzzley app as soon as you manage to pair your device with your user account, following the steps described [here](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/implementing-webhooks).
            
    
## Hardware available
This it totally optional and you donâ€™t even need to touch hardware to create around the IoT World. Nonetheless, to the mighty warriors, we have several Raspberry Piâ€™s, breadboards and some electronic components that you can use to create your project. 

You may also have access to some third party IoT devices that will be at our Dome inside the chill-out area. 


## Workshops
We want you to create the best project and win Pixelâ€™s camp competitionâ€¦ After all, life is IoT, right? :-)
Bootstrap your idea by attending to our workshops happening on *March 22nd* at 10:00AM and 2:00PM inside the Habitâ€™s Dome at Pixelâ€™s camp.
