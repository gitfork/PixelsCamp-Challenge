![Habit](https://github.com/habitio/PixelsCamp-Challenge/blob/master/illustration.png)

## Context
Habit Analytics provides an API and Mobile Application that allows anyone to transform a Dumb device into a Smart Device and create use cases between different devices or event providers.


## Challenge
Control any Device with one single App!

Imagine an usecase that you would like to reach, creating interactions between IoT devices or external APIs or even your mobile.

Some examples:
- Transform your own Dumb device into a Smart Device
- Integrate with a weather API and change our Dome lights (LIFX) accordinatly
- Create a Smart Device with our Hardware (Arduino/RasperryPi/Boards)
    
## How to Apply
* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [application-example-at-habit-io.md](https://github.com/habitio/PixelCamp/blob/master/application-example-at-habit-io.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your email (ex: support-at-habit-io.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Find a Habit member on the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive some hardware if necessary or for any question that you may have.


## Requirements for integrations
* Install [Muzzley App](https://cdn.muzzley.com/apk/muzzley-v3.apk) (apk) on your phone or emulator
* Follow our integration [documentation](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io) 
    * We have already created a generic [specification of a Device](https://muzzleyintegrations.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device-specifications) for you to use with your project:
            * 1 compoment with the following properties:
                * 1 property status (true/false)    
                * 4 properties for strings (property1, property2, property3, property4)
                * 1 property image (url)
                * 1 property orientation (up/down/left/right)
            
    
## Hardware available
We will have several arduinos, raspberry's and boards, that you can use to create your project.
You may also use one our Lifx Lights on Habit's Dome.
